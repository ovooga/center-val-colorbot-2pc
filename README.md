Centre colorbot is a computer-vision mouse aiming system using HSV color detection with MAKCU hardware. Supports NDI, UDP, and Capture Card input, offering customizable sensitivity, smoothing, FOV settings, and anti-smoke filtering for precise 2-PC aiming workflows.

## Features

### Core Modules
- **Aimbot**: Intelligent targeting system with multiple modes (head/body/nearest)
- **Triggerbot**: Automated trigger with burst firing and cooldown management
- **RCS (Recoil Control System)**: Automatic recoil compensation
- **Anti-Smoke Detection**: Advanced filtering to avoid targeting through smoke

### Video Capture Support
- **NDI**: Network Device Interface for streaming video sources
- **UDP**: High-speed UDP video streaming
- **Capture Card**: Direct capture card input support

### Hardware Integration
- **MAKCU USB Device**: High-speed mouse control via serial communication
- **Multi-Device Support**: Compatible with MAKCU, CH343, CH340, CH347, and CP2102
- **High-Speed Communication**: Configurable baud rates up to 4Mbps

### Customization Options
- Adjustable sensitivity and smoothing
- Configurable FOV (Field of View) settings
- Granular display and overlay controls
- Real-time performance monitoring

## Requirements

### Hardware
- **MAKCU USB Device** (or compatible serial adapter: CH343, CH340, CH347, CP2102)
- Windows 10/11
- USB port for MAKCU connection

### Software
- Python 3.12+
- Windows operating system

## Installation

### Method 1: Quick Setup (Recommended)

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ovooga/center-val-colorbot-2pc.git
   cd Centre-colorBot
   ```

2. **Run the setup script**
   ```bash
   setup.bat
   ```
   This will automatically:
   - Check Python installation
   - Create a virtual environment
   - Install all dependencies

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   run.bat
   ```

### Method 2: Manual Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ovooga/center-val-colorbot-2pc.git
   cd Centre-colorBot
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   
   Or use the provided batch file:
   ```bash
   run.bat
   ```

## Usage

### Initial Setup

1. **Connect MAKCU Device**
   - Plug in your MAKCU USB device
   - The application will automatically detect and connect

2. **Configure Video Source**
   - Select capture method: NDI, UDP, or Capture Card
   - Configure connection settings based on your selected method
   - Click "CONNECT" to establish connection

3. **Adjust Settings**
   - Navigate through tabs: General, Aimbot, Sec Aimbot, Trigger, RCS, Config
   - Configure sensitivity, smoothing, FOV, and other parameters
   - Settings are automatically saved to `config.json`

### Configuration Tabs

- **General**: Capture controls, sensitivity, operation mode, target color
- **Aimbot**: Main aiming settings, sensitivity, FOV, offsets, targeting mode
- **Sec Aimbot**: Secondary aimbot configuration
- **Trigger**: Triggerbot settings, delay, hold, burst controls
- **RCS**: Recoil control system parameters
- **Config**: Save/load configuration profiles
